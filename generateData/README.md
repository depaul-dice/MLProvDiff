# How to Produce Data
- Use ```simple.ipynb``` to produce traces from simple graph without loops. 
- Change the paramters ```fan out``` and ```number of samples required``` in the first block.
- The code automatically calculates the required depth to produce the ```required number of samples``` with the given ```fan out```.
- Executing the file will produce outputs in ```.pkl```.
